                        <h2>Applications</h2>
                        <p>turmeric (Curcuma longa) is an intriguing ingredient with a rich history as a dietary spice and herbal supplement in ancient China and India [1]. This distinctive yellow- colored spice, derived from the rhizome of the plant (C. longa), is a member of Zingiberaceae family and is widely cultivated in India and Southeast Asia. The use of turmeric in Asia dates back more than 2000 years where it was used in cooking, medicine, cosmetics and fabric dyes. Tumeric only gained popularity in European society from the 14th century A.D [1]. Turmeric is arguably one of the most widely used spices throughout the world, as evident from its numerous names as adopted by the locals; i.e. ukon, Indian saffron, kurkum, yellow ginger and kunyit basah. A rough estimate by Ravindran showed that at least 20 countries use turmeric in basic food preparation daily [2]. The primary active compound responsible for the yellow color named curcumin was identified in early 1900 by Lampe and Milobedzka [3]. The ‘magic touch’ of turmeric in curing various ailments due to its broad spectrum of pharmacological activities has been noted since ancient times. The ancient Indian holistic medicine known as Ayurveda uses turmeric for the treatment of common eye infections, burns, acne, wound dressing, sprains and swelling [4]. In traditional medicine turmeric is used to enhance the immune system and as a cure for different respiratory diseases such as asthma and for allergy [4]. Tumeric has also been traditionaly used for the treatment of diabetes, cough, sinusitis, flu, rheumatism and liver disorders [4]. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners regularly use turmeric for treating abdominal pain associated diseases [5]. It has widely been accepted since ancient times that this polyphenol compound possesses anti-inflammatory properties [6]. Advancements in modern medicine have revealed many unkown medicinal properties of turmeric which include anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-cancer, anti-microbial and anti-cardiovascular activities [7-3]. Studies have also strongly indicated that curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, is the key ingredient responsible for the major therapeutic activities of turmeric [14, 15]. </p>
