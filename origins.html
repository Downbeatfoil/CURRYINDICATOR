                        <ul>
                            <li>Unlike individual spices in Indian homes, curry powder was crafted for the convenience of British colonizers.</li>
                            <li>Various types of curry powder exist, each with unique blends influenced by different regions and cuisines, such as:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Yellow curry</li>
                            <li>Green curry</li>
                            <li>Red curry</li>
                            <li>Japanese curry powder</li>
                            <li>Jamaican curry powder</li>
                            <li>Indian curry powder</li>

                            <li>Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is an intriguing ingredient with a rich history as a dietary spice and herbal supplement in ancient China and India.</li>
                            <li>The use of turmeric in Asia dates back more than 2000 years where it was used in cooking, medicine, cosmetics and fabric dyes.</li>
                            <li>It gained popularity in European society from the 14th century A.D.</li>
                            <li>Turmeric is arguably one of the most widely used spices throughout the world, known by various names adopted by locals.</li>
                            <li>The primary active compound responsible for the yellow color, named curcumin, was identified in the early 1900s.</li>
                            <li>Advancements in modern medicine have revealed many unknown medicinal properties of turmeric, including anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-cardiovascular activities.</li>
                            <li>Studies strongly indicate that curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, is the key ingredient responsible for the major therapeutic activities of turmeric.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Is it found in nature?</h2>
                        <p> Curcumin is found in nature, primarily sourced from turmeric, a spice derived from the rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant. Turmeric has been recognized for its medicinal properties for thousands of years, and curcumin is its major bioactive component. Curcumin, also known as diferuloylmethane, is a polyphenol naturally occurring in the rhizome of turmeric and other Curcuma species. It has gained significant interest from both the medical and culinary worlds due to its numerous health benefits, including its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, curcumin's bioavailability is poor when ingested alone, primarily due to factors such as poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid elimination. Nonetheless, its bioavailability can be significantly enhanced when combined with agents like piperine, found in black pepper, which can increase curcumin's bioavailability by up to 2000%. Thus, curcumin's benefits are best achieved when sourced from natural turmeric and combined with enhancing agents to improve absorption and efficacy.</p>

                        <h2>First Discovery</h2>
                        <p>Curcumin's journey from discovery to recognition spans over two centuries. In the early 19th century, Vogel and Pelletier isolated a "yellow coloring-matter" from turmeric, naming it curcumin. It wasn't until 1910 that Milobedzka and Lampe identified its chemical structure as diferuloylmethane. Despite its long history of use in Asian countries, curcumin's biological properties were scientifically acknowledged much later.</p>
                        <p>In 1949, Schraufstatter and colleagues published a seminal paper in Nature, revealing curcumin's antibacterial properties against various pathogens. However, scientific interest remained tepid until the 1970s when researchers began unveiling its diverse characteristics, including cholesterol-lowering, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The 1980s witnessed a pivotal moment with Kuttan and colleagues demonstrating curcumin's anti-cancer potential in both laboratory and animal studies.</p>
                        <p>In 1995, another significant breakthrough occurred when a group showcased curcumin's anti-inflammatory prowess by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-ÎºB. This marked a crucial milestone in understanding curcumin's mechanisms of action, laying the groundwork for further exploration of its therapeutic potential. Despite a slow start, curcumin has emerged as a multifaceted compound with promising implications for human health.</p>
