                        <p>In a solution of pH 1–7, curcumin is yellowish and mostly exists in the neutral form (H3A). Curcumin is more stable in acidic conditions probably owing to its conjugated diene structure which is gradually destroyed as the proton is removed during dissociation of phenolic groups in the curcumin structure (H2A−, HA2− and A3−) at higher pH, thus causing curcumin to be more prone to degradation as detected using HPLC (Fig. 44). In the pH range of 8.08 to 8.75, it is postulated that curcumin exists in equilibrium in three forms: H3A, H2A− and HA2− [71].

The kinetic behavior of curcumin degradation in various pH systems. At pH < 1, curcumin appears in protonated form (H4A+). In a solution of pH 1–7, curcumin exists in the neutral form (H3A). In the pH range of 8.08 to 8.75, it is postulated that curcumin exists in equilibrium in three forms: H3A, H2A and HA2.

Chemical structure of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bis-demethoxycurcumin.


In turmeric there three different chemicals that comprise that are found below. We mostly refer to curcumin because it’s the majority. Curcuminoids complex, found in the rhizome of turmeric (2.5–6%) comprises curcumin (curcumin I), demethoxycurcumin [4-hydroxy-cinna [pmoyl- (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl)methane] (curcumin II), bisdemethoxycurcumin [bis-ane] (curcumin III) and cyclocurcumin (Fig. 22). The physicochemical properties of major curcuminoids are listed in Table 22. In commercial grades of curcumin, the major curcuminoid complexes present are curcumin I (77%), curcumin II (17%) and curcumin III (3%). 

 
CONCLUSION 
From the above experiment, curcumin is found to 
be unstable in solution  form. Stability  increases in acidic 
and decreases as the pH increases. Also in the presence of 
light the degradation  was much  higher as compared  to in 
the absence of light. It has been found that that curcumin 
at  pH  1.2  is  highly  stable  in  the  absence  of  light  as 
compared  to  pH  1.2  in  the  presence  of  light.  Stability 
decreases  as  the  pH  of  the  solution  increases  with  the 
formation of its degraded products such as ferulic acid and 
vanillin.

Fun Facts:
Photodegradation of Curcumin
Curcumin is also sensitive to light and is rapidly decolorized upon exposure to UV light [76, 77]. According to Auslander et al., complete color loss of curcuminoid pigments in turmeric occured within three days of exposure to 900 footcandle of visible light [78]. Khurana and Ho reported that the dried powder form of curcumin was more stable to photo-oxidation as compared to the alcoholic extract [77]. In addition to that, the rate of curcumin photodegradation was influenced to a large extent by the nature of solvents used [77]. Tønnesen and Karlsen showed that stability of curcumin (as measured by half-life in various solvents) followed the decreasing trend: methanol (92.7 h) > ethyl acetate (15.1 h) > acetonitrile (6.3 h) > chloroform (2.7 h) [71]. It was probable that the significant protective or destabilizing effect of different solvents could be ascribed to the formation of inter- and intra-molecular bondings, which were solvent dependent [71]. Souza et al. found that the combination effect of air and light was more detrimental than light alone while the absorption of curcumin in water had no apparent effect on curcumin photo-stability [79]. In another study, the order of photochemical stability of different curcuminoid complexes in air-sparged conditions in methanol was curcumin > demethoxycurcumin > bis demethoxycurcumin [80].
